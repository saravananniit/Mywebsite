In 2019, LePage used Flexbox and media queries to implement five layout patterns:

Mostly Fluid: On small screens, content reflows and columns stack vertically. On bigger screens, margins are adjusted.

Column Drop: Columns stack vertically on smaller screens.

Layout Shifter: Content moves around when screen sizes change. Most responsive with many breakpoints but also more complex to maintain.

Tiny Tweaks: Only small changes involving font sizes, image dimensions, or content offsets.

Off Canvas: On smaller screens, less frequently used content is kept off-screen but accessible with a single click.
